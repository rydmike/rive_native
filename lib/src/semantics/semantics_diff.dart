/// Incremental semantic delta produced by the native runtime and consumed

///
/// ## Ordering contract
///
/// All lists are emitted in deterministic tree order so a consumer can apply
/// them in a single pass without a deferred-attachment queue:
///
/// * [added], [moved], [updatedSemantic], [updatedGeometry] — current-tree
///   pre-order. For any entry, its parent (if present in the same list or
///   already resident) has been emitted earlier.
/// * [removed] — previous-tree pre-order.
/// * [childrenUpdated] — parent ids appear in the order their subtrees are
///   first entered during a pre-order walk of the current tree; parents that
///   only existed in the previous tree are appended in previous-tree order.
///
/// A minimal adapter can therefore process the lists in the order declared by
/// [SemanticsDiff] fields (removed → added → moved → childrenUpdated →
/// updatedSemantic → updatedGeometry) and, within each list, iterate linearly.
