## 0.2.0-dev.3

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.
- Adds `RiveFocusWidget`: wrap a Rive widget with it and the graphic joins Flutter's keyboard focus. Tab and Shift+Tab traverse the content's focus tree and leave it at either end, arrow keys move focus by position, keys and typed characters reach the focused node (a `TextInput` can be edited), and Rive focus clears when Flutter focus leaves the widget. Content without focus nodes is never a tab stop. `StateMachinePainter` provides the state machine through the new `RiveKeyboardFocusMixin`.
- Adds `StateMachine.hasFocusNodes` and `StateMachine.focusState` (`FocusState`: `hasFocus`, `expectsKeyboardInput`).
- Adds `File.artboardNames`, the artboard names in file order.

### Fixes

- Android: multiple `RiveWidget`s no longer throttle each other or stay blank under load, and heavy Rive content no longer drags down the app's frame rate.
- Animations keep their speed when frames are skipped under load, and no longer jump ahead when rendering pauses briefly, such as the iOS app switcher.
- Windows: the Rive Renderer runs on GPUs limited to Direct3D feature level 11_0. Apps on that hardware used to crash on the first file load.
- Windows: when the Rive Renderer cannot start (no GPU adapter or D3D11 device), decoding a file with `Factory.rive` returns null instead of crashing. Fall back to `Factory.flutter`.
- Fixes a possible crash when a render texture and its deferred recording session are disposed in either order.

## 0.2.0-dev.2

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

### Data binding

- Adds global view model support: `File.globalViewModelNames`, plus `StateMachine.setViewModelInstance` / `setGlobalViewModelInstance` to stage instances, `bind()` to apply them in a single rebind (unset slots get default instances), and `globalViewModelInstance(name)` to read them back. Property listeners on global instances fire on advance. Instances you create are `BindableViewModelInstance` - the only type the staging calls accept. Instances read back from bound slots are plain `ViewModelInstance` views: read, write, and listen to them, but binding one again is a compile error (and a cast throws at runtime) - create your own instance to share state.

### Fixes

- iOS: audio resumes when the app returns from the background. See [#563](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/563).
- Web: the deferred render worker works again on the Emscripten 4 build, which stopped exporting heap views on `Module`.
- Web: a widget that reuses a pooled canvas no longer shows the previous widget's last frame, stretched to its own layout, until its first frame lands.
- Semantics: screen reader actions (tap, increase, decrease, focus) now work after the animation settles and stops producing frames, matching pointer input behavior.
- Semantics: swapping the artboard on a painter resets the semantic tree, so nodes from the previous artboard no longer collide with the new one.
- Semantics: a node reparented out of a removed parent is no longer dropped from the accessibility tree.
- Semantics: malformed UTF-8 in a label, value, or hint no longer aborts the whole semantics update.
- Semantics: the semantic tree survives widget unmount/remount with a kept painter (e.g. navigating away from a route and back), instead of coming back permanently empty.
- Semantics: children of a zero-area node are promoted into its parent instead of being dropped with it, matching the Android runtime's behavior.
- Semantics: moving screen reader focus away from a Rive element now clears its focused state.
- Semantics: turning the screen reader off and back on no longer crashes with a framework assert.

## 0.2.0-dev.1

- GPU Canvas support at runtime, enabled through deferred rendering.

### Deferred rendering

The Rive Renderer (`Factory.rive`) now uses deferred rendering on native platforms, and it is the only native mode. Each frame is recorded on the UI thread as a compact command stream and replayed on a dedicated render thread, so GPU work no longer blocks the UI thread. Resources made with `Factory.rive` (paths, paints, images, text) are lightweight recording proxies that resolve during replay. Rendering behavior and output are unchanged for typical `RiveWidget` / file-based usage; the changes below
matter when migrating advanced integrations.

Migrating:

- All Rive calls stay on the calling (UI) thread. The command stream has a single writer per frame, so advancing or drawing from other threads is not supported.
- **Breaking**: removes `Rive.batchAdvance` and `Rive.batchAdvanceAndRender` (and the native batch worker). Their worker threads recorded into the command stream concurrently and corrupted it. Advance and draw each state machine on the calling thread instead.
- `RenderTexturePainter.riveFactory` names the factory the painted content was made with, so the texture attaches its recording session (a sessionless texture draws nothing on native). Defaults to `Factory.rive` override with the decoded file's `File.riveFactory` when content records elsewhere (on web this opts single-file content into the per-file session worker path), or with null when the session is managed manually.
- One artboard instance per texture: showing the same artboard instance in two widgets leaves the later one blank, with a debug message. Create an artboard instance per widget.
- `Factory.rive` on native resolves to the render context's recording session. `file.riveFactory == Factory.rive` still holds, and resources created directly on `Factory.rive` record and render correctly.
- Advanced session control (manual attach/detach via `RenderTexture.useDeferredSession`, pacing, thread stats) is available through `package:rive_native/rive_deferred.dart`.

### Fixes

- Corrected the minimum Flutter version to 3.32.0 (Dart 3.8.0). It was declared as 3.28.0, so older Flutter versions resolved this package and then failed to compile in the semantics overlay, which has required 3.32.0 since 0.1.6. See [#643](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/643).

## 0.1.11

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.
- Adds `RenderResolution` to control how a `Factory.rive` texture sizes its backing store: `display()` (default — layout × device pixel ratio × ancestor paint scale), `layout({scale})` (layout × device pixel ratio, ignores ancestor transforms), and `fixed(width, height)` (explicit physical pixels). Available on `RenderTexture.widget`, `RiveArtboardWidget`, and `RiveProceduralRenderingWidget`.
- **Web behavior change**: `RenderResolution.display()` now accounts for ancestor transforms on web, matching native — an upscaled widget renders sharp instead of stretched. Pass `RenderResolution.layout()` for the previous behavior.
- Adds `RiveNative.instance.releaseRenderResources()` to release cached render resources (web: pooled textures and the probe context), recreated on demand. No-op on other platforms.
- Adds `RiveNative.debugRenderTextureLogging` (web): logs render-texture create/reuse/release with live WebGL context counts.

### Fixes

- Windows: fixed a crash or hang when disposing a render texture with a frame in flight, such as closing the app under load or the desktop going to sleep. The fence wait thread could outlive teardown and either touch a destroyed texture registrar or block shutdown indefinitely (see core runtime issue [#86](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-runtime/issues/86)).
- Texture allocations under `display` and `layout` are capped at 4096 logical pixels per axis (aspect preserved), preventing runaway allocations under large ancestor scales.
- Web: canvas backing stores are clamped to the GPU's maximum render-target size.
- Web: render textures release their WebGL contexts on dispose (bounded reuse pool), browser-evicted contexts are purged instead of reused, and the MSAA probe context is released at startup — fixes context-limit exhaustion and permanently blank widgets.

## 0.1.10

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

### Fixes

- Rive Renderer (`Factory.rive`) rendering issues on Linux with later versions of Flutter (3.38+, see Flutter issue [182998](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/182998))
- Various Rive scripting fixes and updates, notably:
  - Updated Luau to 0.728
  - Fixed the Lua `Data` global not being initialized, which left view model constructors such as `Data.MyViewModel.new()` unavailable to scripts

## 0.1.9

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

### Fixes

- Fixed a "RenderBox was not laid out" crash in `RiveNativeRenderBox.paint` (`Factory.rive`) that could occur when painting during certain transitions. See https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/642.
- Touch and stylus pointer up (and cancel) now also dispatch a pointer exit, so listeners receive a Pointer Exit when a finger or pen lifts. This keeps enter/exit symmetric on mobile and matches other Rive runtimes. Mouse and trackpad pointers are unaffected, their exit still comes from the pointer leaving the artboard/widget.
- Fixed a crash when using `desktop_multi_window` on Windows with MicroProfile GPU init

## 0.1.8

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

### Fixes

- Fixed Rive widgets blurring (`Factory.rive`) during parent rotation/skew animations.
- Improved `RiveWidget` (`Factory.rive`) flickering when resized. The render texture is reused and scaled during a resize, recreated at the new size on a throttle, and only swapped in once it has been drawn.

### Changes

- Deprecated `RenderTexture.onTextureChanged` in favour of `addTextureChangedListener` / `removeTextureChangedListener`, which allow multiple painters to share a single texture.
- Added `RiveNativeRenderBox.textureResizeInterval` to tune how often the texture is recreated while resizing.

## 0.1.7

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

### Breaking Changes

- Expose audio events through the Dart API. `Event` is a sealed class and `EventType` gains an `audio` value, so exhaustive `switch` statements over either now require a new `AudioRuntimeEvent` / `EventType.audio` arm.
- State machine event listeners now receive `AudioRuntimeEvent`s alongside `GeneralEvent` and `OpenUrlEvent`. Listeners that branch on event type with non-exhaustive `if`/`is` checks will see the new type pass through unhandled.

### Fixes

- Fixed a Windows crash in the `removeTexture` method channel handler when the texture id arrived as `int32_t` rather than `int64_t`. Most commonly seen when dragging the app window between displays with different DPI settings, or when rapidly creating/disposing render textures.

## 0.1.6

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

### Fixes

- Fixed [623](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/623) - Explicitly nil Metal ivars in dealloc to prevent use-after-free on teardown

## 0.1.5

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

- Add optional `viewModelInstance` parameter to `File.artboardToBind`, allowing a `ViewModelInstance` to be bound to a `BindableArtboard`. When provided, the view model instance is set on the artboard property in the core runtime.

## 0.1.4

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

### Build & Platform Updates

- Rive Renderer support for Linux
- Linux is now fully supported. Known issue: arm64 builds are not yet included; for now, build manually: https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/flutter/rive-native#building-rive-native
- Fixes a build issue where scripting build files were missing. We previously did not include the `scripting` folder, which is now required by other build files.
- Fixed a build issue when running ``dart run rive_native:setup --build`.
- Resolves `dart run rive_native:setup` concurrency issue [rive-flutter#609](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/609). Downloads now use a unique temporary directory to support concurrent CLI runners.

## 0.1.3

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

### Build & Platform Updates

- Adds Swift Package Manager support. Resolves issue [557](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/557)

## 0.1.2

- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.
- Updated the minimum Flutter version to `3.28.0`. The Android platform code requires the new `onSurfaceCleanup` and `onSurfaceAvailable` methods, see [SurfaceProducer](https://api.flutter.dev/javadoc/io/flutter/view/TextureRegistry.SurfaceProducer.Callback.html).
- Add `enumType` string getter to `ViewModelInstanceEnum` which returns the name of the enum (not the property name).
- Add `valueStream<T>` to data binding properties that are observable (implementations of `ViewModelInstanceObservableValue`), which returns a `Stream<T>`. For example:

```
ViewModelInstanceNumber? numberProperty = viewModelInstance!.number('age');
Stream<double> stream = numberProperty!.valueStream;
```

### Fixes

- Fixed iOS/macOS build issues when using custom schemes and flavors. See issue [594](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/594).

## 0.1.1

- Adds runtime [Rive Scripting](https://rive.app/docs/scripting/getting-started) support.
- Updates the Rive C++ runtime and renderer for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

### Fixes

- Fixed [585](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/585) - missing `artboard` `DataType` enum.

## 0.1.0

### Fixes

- Fixed Android build issues in certain environments. See issue [555](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/555). Build commands are now executed from Gradle instead of CMakeLists, and the setup process automatically skips `rive_native:setup` if the required libraries are already downloaded.

### Build & Platform Updates

- Android: Added support for skipping automated setup by setting `rive.native.skipSetup=true` in your app's `gradle.properties`. When enabled, you must manually run `dart run rive_native:setup --verbose --clean --platform android` to download the required libraries.

## 0.0.17

- Marks methods to access text runs and state machine inputs as deprecated. While this functionality won't be removed in the near future, we encourage adoption of data binding to future-proof your Rive usage.

### Fixes

- Improved library loading and error message. See issue [566](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/566)
- Fixed layout issues that occurred on first render when using `Fit.layout` by correcting the order of artboard resizing and advancing calls. Added a new `RiveArtboardLayoutMixin` that provides common layout options for painters, including fit mode, alignment, and scale factor controls.
- Resolves an issue where under some conditions the graphic may not restart the animation ticker. Adds a `isTickerActive` to `RivePainter`.
- Fixed a lifetime issue with `FileAsset`s when the owning Rive `File` is destroyed.
- Only send `textureFrameAvailable` on main (platform) thread (iOS and macOS). This likely resolves crashes observed during Flutter engine teardown when using `Factory.rive`.

- Resolved [an issue](https://community.rive.app/c/support/rive-native-rendering-visible-aliasing-jagged-edges) where upscaling Rive widget transforms resulted in blurry textures when using `Factory.rive`.
- Fixed layout problems that occurred when certain `Fit` modes were used and the user switched to a different DPI screen.
- Adds `addAdvanceRequestListener` to `StateMachine` and `ViewModelInstance`. This is used internally by the `rive` package to force advance on view model property change, and input changes.
- Fixed instances where pointer exit was not working

## 0.0.8

- Expose `width` and `height` getters for `ImageAsset`. See issue [501](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/501). This is only exposed to support older workflows. We now recommend using [Data Binding images](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/data-binding#images). You can also alternatively expose the width and height of the component through data binding and listen to changes.

### Fixes

- Fixed a memory leak when listening to Rive Events that had Audio events. See issue [494](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-flutter/issues/494)
- Fixed a memory issue on WASM where large .riv files could invalidate our backing TypedArray views. This fix recreates these views if they are detached. See: https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/7294

  You can now data bind artboards and update them programatically. Access a `ViewModelInstanceArtboard` by its path using `artboard(String path)` on a view model instance. To update, set the `value` by passing in a `BindableArtboard`. Create a `BindableArtboard` from a Rive file: `riveFile.artboardToBind(String name)` See the [runtime](https://rive.app/docs/runtimes/data-binding) docs for data binding artboards.
- **Detect Rive Renderer support**:
  You can now detect Rive Renderer support by doing `Factory.rive.isSupported` after `RiveNative.init()`.

### Fixes

  - Set the `value` to `null` to clear the image and free up resources.
- Exposes the `name` string getter on `Artboard`, `Animation`, and `StateMachine`.

### Fixes

- Fixed a build issue when creating an Android AAR module. `rive_native` now accounts for the `plugins_build_output` directory when running the build scripts.

## 0.0.1-dev.5

- Initial prerelease 🎉
